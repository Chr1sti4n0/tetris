# How To Play
Start the game by pressing the "Start/Pause" button. The tetrominoes will make their way down the screen automatically. You can make the tetrominoes fall faster by pressing the down arrow key "⬇️". Pressing the right "➡️" and left "⬅️" arrow keys will move the tetromino left and right. If you would like to change the rotation of the tetromino, simply press the up "⬆️" arrow key. The next tetromino to be provided is displayed in the small box on the right side (see below).
